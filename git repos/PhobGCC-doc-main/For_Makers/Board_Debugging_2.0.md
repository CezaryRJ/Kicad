# Sticks Inoperable

If both sticks are nonfunctional and stuck in one corner, check for shorts between C-stick wires.
Shorting these can prevent communication with both ADCs at the same time.

If only the C-Stick is inoperable, it's likely a bad connection without a short.

# Won't Connect to Console

Check if the PhobVision voltage is nonzero.
If it is, the Z button may be stuck closed and forcing the controller into PhobVision mode.
